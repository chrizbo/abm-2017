This is the work I am doing for the Agent Based Modeling MOOC from Santa Fe Institute, class of 2017.

## Final project

The final project is a NetLogo model focused on the following:

>Finding product/market fit through interactions with consumers. There are many different product development strategies (e.g. early feedback, getting to market first, etc.) and this model starts to analyze the impact is for these different strategies on longer term sales (the end goal of startups).
>
>This NetLogo model simulates the process by which producers find product market fit with consumers. Product market fit is how a producer’s value proposition of their product matches the consumer’s underserved needs.

The model is in this repo as [produce-market-fit.nlogo](https://github.com/chrizbo/abm-2017/blob/master/product-market-fit.nlogo).

Analysis can be found in the [product-market-fit-analysis](https://github.com/chrizbo/abm-2017/blob/master/product-market-fit-analysis.ipynb).
